      "pitfalls": "Due to context length limitations in chats, ChatGPT wasn't much help in organizing the flow of the book, and I often didn't do a great job of this myself as I was drafting each chapter, so the book bobs around a bit and only loosely is pointed at any particular themes. \r\n\r\nBoth using the Canvas tool (which I gave up on after the first few sessions) and having random factoids from my drafts constantly being added to memories were inconveniences of using ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nGiving chat my drafts bit by bit lead to it producing a lot of repetition, poor transitions between paragraphs, and a lack of connecting stories to the common themes in the book; and I didn't give myself quite enough time to do as good of a review and rewriting process as I would have liked.",
